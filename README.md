# CI Build Slack Notifier

Script is meant to be used with Continuous Integration server like Jenkins to notify about build state by sending messages to Slack. It is written as a simple alternative to offical [Slack plugin for Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin). However, because this project is a simple Node script, it can be used with different server than Jenkins or whatever service you're using. Moreover, it can be used without the CI server getting info only from GIT.

Notifier get build info and current commit from environment variables or last commit, combine them with custom message and color and then send message to your Slack webhook. You can see the output below.

If you don't want to use Slack, you can show combined info in console, see options below.

## Supported CIs

See package [env-ci on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-ci).

## Install

      }
    }
